Introduction: During PerScholas admission process, I was given Rock Paper Scissor as a coding challenge question to  Psedocode. At that moment I did not about this game so I went through all the rules of the game which was provided as a link and then with in time frame limit I came up with my Psedocode. I was always tempted to code my algorithm so when creating the game  as project oppotunity came ,I was really excited and selected Rock Paper Scissor as my project. you can access my game on the github by

About VS code(JAVASCRIPT)

 I have designed this game to play against computer. Player name is choosen with a Prompt box and assigned to the player oblect.
************************************************************
let playerName = prompt(
    "please enter your name to play against computer",
    "Sami"
  );

  if (playerName != " ") {
    playerOBj.name = playerName;
  }

*************************************************************

Player is then prompted to enter number of turns he/she wants to play.

numberTurn = prompt(
    `${playerName} how many times you want to play. please enter a number to proceed`
  );

  if (numberTurn !== "0" && numberTurn !== "") {
    numberTurn = parseInt(numberTurn);

    let turn = document.querySelector(".update_turn");
   
    turn.innerHTML = `<h2> Total turns: ${numberTurn}</h2>`;

*******************************************************************
 
A random option will be generated from the computerâ€™s side

function getComputerOption() {
      const options = ["rock", "paper", "scissor"];
      const option = options[Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length)];
      return option;
    }

*******************************************************************


 The player has to choose one option among the rock, paper, and scissors.  
 
 let rockbtn = document.querySelector(".rock");
    let paperbtn = document.querySelector(".paper");
    let scissorbtn = document.querySelector(".scissor");

    let imageContainer = document.querySelector(".image_container");
    let icontainer = document.querySelector(".inside_container");
    console.dir(imageContainer);
    // }

    let playerChoice = [rockbtn, paperbtn, scissorbtn];

    An eventlistner is added to each button and Play() function is called so when player picks his/her choice, Images corresponding to their choice pops up in the image container.

       playerChoice.forEach((choice) => choice.addEventListener("click", play));

    let playerScore = 0;
    let computerScore = 0;

    imageContainer.classList.add("image_container_display");

      // getting inside image container choice for user pick and computer pick

      let image_src = document.querySelectorAll(".img");

      image_src[0].src = getImageSrc(playerPick);
      //image_src[0].style.animate="rotate"
      image_src[1].src = getImageSrc(computerPick);

******************************************************************
  Function  getImageSrc(option) helps to show user picked choice and computer picked choice in the image container

  function getImageSrc(option) {
      if (option === "rock") {
        return "rock.png";
      } else if (option === "paper") {
        return "paper.png";
      } else option === "scissor";
      return "scissor.png";
    }
 
 *****************************************************************

 when user and computer picks their choice then

  funtion winnerDecision() is called which follows all the games rules to decide who won in that turn. This function calls following function  to decide the winner of that turn.
  
  tieScore() -----> if game tie
  playerwinStats()------->if player wins
  computerwinStats()------->if computer wins

 

    winnerDecision(playerPick, computerPick);

if (player === computer) {
        tieScore(computerScoreUpdate, playerScoreUpdate, result);
      } else if (player === "rock") {
        if (computer === "paper") {
          computerwinStats(result, computerScoreUpdate);
        } else {
          playerwinStats(result, playerScoreUpdate);
        }
      } else if (player === "scissor") {
        if (computer === "rock") {
          computerwinStats(result, computerScoreUpdate);
        } else {
          playerwinStats(result, playerScoreUpdate);
        }
      } else if (player === "paper") {
        if (computer == "scissor") {
          computerwinStats(result, computerScoreUpdate);
        } else {
          playerwinStats(result, playerScoreUpdate);
        }
      }
      return playerScore, computerScore;
    }

***************************************************************
After each turn turn count is checked to see if all the turns are finished. If so then gameOver() function is called to calculate the final winner.This function checks if game tie or there is win/lose state.

 function gameOver(playerChoice, turn)

 this function disables all three button so user can not click any more.

  playerChoice.forEach((option) => {
        option.style.display = "none";
        imageContainer.classList.remove("image_container_display");
      });

Logic to see final winner

  if (playerScore > computerScore) {
        result.style.color = "blue";
        result.innerHTML = `<img src="winner.png" class="img_style" ><h2>${playerOBj.name} Won the Game</h2>`;
       
      } else if (playerScore < computerScore) {
        result.style.color = "red";
        result.innerHTML = `<img src="loser.png" class="img_style" ><h2>${playerOBj.name} lost the Game</h2>`;
       
      } else {
        result.style.color = "yellow";
        result.innerHTML = `<img src="tie.png" class="img_style" ><h2>Game Tie </h2>`;
        
      }

After this final result is dispalyed on the screen

turn.style.display = "flex";
      turn.innerHTML = "<h2>Game Over!!</h2>";
      
After Two new buttons pop up
Restart button reset the window location and game restarts

 restart.innerText = "Restart";
      restart.style.display = "flex";

      restart.addEventListener("click", () => {
        window.location.reload();
      });

EndGame button ends the game and shows default browser

      endgame.innerText = "End Game";
      endgame.style.display = "flex";

      endgame.addEventListener("click", () => {
        icontainer.style.display = "none";
      });
    }


****************************************************************************

Lastly if  the user does not enter any turns to play against computer then program disable all the DIV and blank browser appers

else {
    let icontainer = document.querySelector(".inside_container");
    icontainer.style.display = "none";
    setTimeout(() =>
      alert("you did not enter any turns to play.See you next time", 300)
    );
  }
}


The game is responsive so that it can be played on small device.
